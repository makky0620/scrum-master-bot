# Facilitator Selection Feature

## Requirements ✓
- Create a facilitator selection feature that randomly selects from input users
- Input: List of users (participants)
- Output: Randomly selected facilitator from the input list

## Understanding from README ✓
- Command should be `/facilitator participants: [comma-separated names]`
- This will randomly select one participant as the facilitator

## Implementation Plan ✓
1. Create facilitator command following the existing Command interface ✓
2. Accept participants as comma-separated string input ✓
3. Parse the input and randomly select one participant ✓
4. Return the selected facilitator in a user-friendly format ✓

## Technical Details ✓
- Follow the same pattern as planningPoker.ts ✓
- Use SlashCommandBuilder for command definition ✓
- Implement Command interface with data and execute methods ✓
- Handle edge cases (empty input, single participant, etc.) ✓

## Test Cases Implemented ✓
1. Command structure validation (name, description, options) ✓
2. Random selection functionality ✓
3. Input parsing (comma-separated names) ✓
4. Edge cases (empty input, single participant, duplicate names) ✓
5. Response formatting ✓

## Implementation Status: COMPLETED ✓
